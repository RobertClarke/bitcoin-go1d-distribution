# Bitcoin Go1d Bar Distribution

This repo serves to establish provenance for the distribution of the Bitcoin Go1d Ordinal collection.

## distribution-script

1. I'll commit the intent to distribute with an address and future block height to distribution_intent.txt
2. After the block height, I'll run selection.py and distributed.txt will be updated with the distribution information.
